# Introduction
Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled systems capable of generating natural, human-like responses to complex queries.
However, pure generative models often lack factual grounding, especially in scientific domains where accuracy is paramount.

To address this, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a hybrid architecture — combining retrieval from a knowledge base with contextual reasoning via generation.
The Virtual Chemistry RAG Lab applies this paradigm to the field of chemistry education by creating a virtual experiment environment where users can mix chemical reactants, observe AI-generated outcomes, and understand underlying scientific principles.

The project focuses on:

- Domain-specific knowledge retrieval (Chemistry)
- Transparent and explainable AI reasoning
- Multimodal user interaction for simulation and learning
- Methodology
The system consists of three key layers:

- Frontend (Streamlit Interface) – Provides an interactive, visual lab environment.
- RAG Core Engine – Combines retrieval and generation using semantic embeddings.
- Vector Database Layer – Stores and retrieves chemistry knowledge in vectorized form.


# 3.1 Data Preparation

## Knowledge Source:
The data/ directory contains curated .txt documents representing verified chemistry knowledge such as:

- reactions_knowledge.txt — common inorganic reactions
- water_formation.txt — oxidation and hydrogen combustion
- biotechnology.txt — cross-disciplinary test file
## Text Preprocessing:
Documents are cleaned, tokenized, and chunked into semantically coherent units.

# 3.2 Vectorization and Retrieval

- Each text chunk is embedded using SentenceTransformer to generate fixed-size semantic vectors.

- Vectors are stored locally using a lightweight vector store (FAISS/Chroma) for offline access.

- Queries are embedded and compared using cosine similarity, returning the most relevant context.

# 3.3 Generation and Prompt Engineering

## 🧩 Prompt Template Design
The Virtual Chemistry RAG Lab employs a structured prompt-based reasoning framework embedded within the RAGAssistant class.
This design ensures that the language model operates under controlled scientific constraints, adapting its reasoning behavior according to the selected operational mode —** Strict or Creative.**

The prompt structure consists of two key components:

- System Prompt — Defines the assistant’s personality, safety rules, and factual boundaries.

- User Template — Dynamically injects the retrieved contextual text and user query during runtime.

### 1️⃣ System Prompt (Strict Mode)
Used when the model must produce strictly factual responses derived only from the retrieved knowledge base.
You are ChemGPT, a Virtual Chemistry Lab Assistant that answers ONLY
based on the retrieved knowledge base context. This is STRICT mode.

Rules:

- NEVER hypothesize or guess missing reactions.
- NEVER reference unrelated reactions or analogies.
- If context lacks information, say exactly:
- "No known reaction found in current knowledge base."
- Refuse unsafe, illegal, or manipulative questions.
- Use concise scientific tone with markdown formatting.
Remember: You are not generating — you are retrieving factual info only.

This configuration enforces retrieval integrity — the model is constrained to operate purely within the context of verified chemistry data.
It prevents hallucination and maintains scientific trustworthiness.

#### [A] If Retrieval found in strict mode 

![Strictmode-retrieve ](images/hil.png)

If any retrieval happens then it is sent to remaining 2 agents for fact checking and safety checking.

### Safety Agent

#### [B] If Retrieval not found in strict mode

### 2️⃣ System Prompt (Creative Mode)
Used when the model is allowed to perform guided reasoning or educational expansion beyond the retrieved text.
You are ChemGPT Creative Mode — a Chemistry Assistant that combines
the retrieved context with your general scientific knowledge.

Rules:

- Start from context if available.
- If missing, you MAY infer plausible scientific explanations.
- Label inferred parts clearly, e.g., "Based on known chemistry..."
- Always include safety notes and clear disclaimers.
- Keep the tone educational and accurate.
This configuration encourages exploratory reasoning while maintaining transparency — any inference is explicitly labeled, ensuring the distinction between factual and generated content.

It is now passed to other 2 agents for further factual and safety checking

### Safety Agent

### 3️⃣ User Prompt Template
Both modes utilize a shared template that injects retrieved text and user query into the LLM input during inference:
Context:
{context}

User Question:
{question}
Answer:

This template ensures a consistent reasoning pipeline — the assistant always grounds its answers in retrieved context before generating a response.
User Prompt:
Reaction between Zn and HCl.
This ensures factuality, educational tone, and consistent structure across responses.

# Modes of Operation
## 4.1 Retrieval Mode (Offline)

- Uses only locally stored .txt documents.
- Works entirely offline — suitable for educational institutions.
- Ensures traceable and verifiable outputs (no hallucinations).

## 4.2 Chat Mode (Interactive Q&A)

- Leverages generative AI reasoning (LLM) for conceptual discussions.
- Offers explanatory, exploratory, and creative chemistry interactions.
- Enables contextual dialogue (“Why does heating sodium release light?”).

# ⚙️ Setup & Usage Guide — Virtual Chemistry RAG Lab
This guide walks you through every step to set up, configure, and run the Virtual Chemistry RAG Lab — from environment creation to API key setup and app execution.

## 🧪 1️⃣ Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- 🐍 Python 3.10+
- 💾 pip (Python package manager)
- 🌐 Internet connection (for model API access)
- 🧰 Git
- 🔐 API Key
  
##  🧬 2️⃣ Clone the Repository
### Clone the project
```bash
git clone 
https://github.com/Blessy456b/rag_lab.git
```
### Move into the project folder
```bash
cd rag_lab/src
```
### 🧱 3️⃣ Create and Activate a Virtual Environment
It is best practice to use an isolated virtual environment to manage project dependencies.

🐧 Linux / macOS:
```bash
python3 -m venv rag_lab_env
source rag_lab_env/bin/activate
```
### 📦 4️⃣ Install Required Dependencies
Once your virtual environment is active, install all dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This installs:

- Streamlit (UI framework)
- LangChain (RAG orchestration)
- SentenceTransformers (embedding model)
- Groq LLM interfaces
- dotenv (for API key management)
- 
### 🔐 5️⃣ API Key Setup
Your assistant supports GROQ model backend

Provider Model Example Environment Variable

🧠 Groq llama-3.1-8b-instant GROQ_API_KEY
🔧 Create a .env file inside /src:
```bash
nano .env
```
# Copy to .env and fill values
```bash
SERPAPI_API_KEY= "< Please fill your Serp API KEY >"
MCP_SECRET= "< Please fill MCP Key or your secret key  >"

MCP_BASE=http://127.0.0.1:8080/tool

# Optional LLM keys (only needed for creative mode)
GROQ_API_KEY="< Please fill your GROK API key >"
```
⚠️ Security Note:
Do not share .env files or commit them to GitHub.
Instead, include a .env_example file showing the required variable names without real values.

### ⚗️ 6️⃣ Run the Application
Make sure that you are in src directory ; if not run - 
```bash
cd rag_lab/src
```
### ⚙️ 3️⃣ Export MCP_SECRET before starting the backend

When you start your backend server, you’ll want this environment variable available to any process (especially the Streamlit app).

Run:
```bash
export MCP_SECRET="<YOUR_RANDOM_SECRET>"
```
This ensures the app can verify requests coming from your MCP server.

### 🚀 4️⃣ Run the MCP (FastAPI or Uvicorn) server

If your project has a FastAPI server (say in mcp_server.py):
```bash
uvicorn mcp_server:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8080 --reload
```

#### ✅ It will now be available at http://127.0.0.1:8080/tool — exactly what MCP_BASE expects.

### 🧠 5️⃣ Run the Streamlit UI

In another terminal (same venv):
```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```
You’ll see something like:
- ✅ VectorDB initialized: rag_documents
- ✅ Chemistry Assistant ready in _____ Mode.

#### Option 1 — Streamlit Interface (Recommended)
Launch the interactive chemistry lab UI:
```bash
streamlit run app_lab_chat.py
```
Once launched, open the local URL displayed in your terminal (e.g., 
http://localhost:8501
) to interact with the assistant.
You’ll see:
- Input Textbox for entering reactants
- Visual test tubes

#### Option 2 — CLI Testing (Without UI)
If you prefer to test the logic from terminal:
```bash
python3 rag_assistant.py
```
# 🧠 7️⃣ Understanding Operational Modes
The RAG assistant supports two reasoning modes:

Mode Behavior Use Case
- ⚖️ Strict Mode Answers only from retrieved knowledge base Verified scientific facts
- 🎨 Creative Mode Combines retrieved context + LLM reasoning Educational explanations, inferences

To change mode:

assistant = RAGAssistant(mode="creative")
or
toggle in GUI

# 🚀 9️⃣ Example Queries to Try
Once running, try:
- “What happens when zinc reacts with hydrochloric acid?”
- “Explain oxidation .”
The assistant retrieves factual data from your /data folder and generates an explainable, contextual response.

# 🧩 1️⃣0️⃣ Troubleshooting
Issue Possible Cause Solution
- No API key found - .env missing or wrong variable name = Verify key name matches table above
- ImportError: sentence_transformers - Dependencies not installed = Run pip install -r requirements.txt
- Streamlit not found - Virtual env not activated = Activate environment again
- Slow responses- Free-tier model rate limits Try smaller queries or switch model provider

# 🧾 1️⃣1️⃣ Next Steps
🧠 Add small new .txt files to the data/ folder for more reactions.
